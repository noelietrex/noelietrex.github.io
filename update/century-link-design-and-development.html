			<p>This was a unique opportunity to capture business. The client was using a competitor's services because they believed that while our company offered a better product, we were only able to provide antiquated design. Since this was not a current, paying client, this was not a design project that could be incorporated into the design team's workflow. I got the opportunity to sketch up, and build out this design for the sales team to present in hopes of winning the business. It worked, the client was won over by the desktop as well as mobile display, and it was a big win all around.</p>

			<p>My favorite part of this process was taking the client's diagonal design element which only existed as a part of flat images, and bringing it to life with CSS. Rather than having the slash only as a part of the banner display, making the mobile experience inferior, I was able to use a CSS diagonal that changes directions from horizontal to vertical for mobile display.</p>
